            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Jacques Lamé. At the moment I'm a 6 VWO student enrolled in a specialised coding track at the Metis Montessori Lyceum in Amsterdam. I am familiar with a wide range of programming languages, like python, C++, C# and JavaScript. Over the last few years I've worked on various projects, on which I'll explain further on this website.</p>

            <h2>C++ Course</h2>
            <p>From autumn 2020 to January 2021, a group of classmates and I took part in an introductory C++ course given by Thilo Kielmann from the VU university in Amsterdam. This course covered the same curriculum as the course would have for the university students and covered the basics that one would need to start programming in C++. The course consisted of a weekly lecture in addition to several hours of working on assignments a week.</p>

            <h2>Text-Adventure Game</h2>
            <p>This unnamed text-adventure game is a project I worked on in late 2021. The goal of the player would be to gather 3 specific objects tagged with 'victory'. The game is played in the console, and different maps could be chosen by loading in different JSON files. A simple combat system exists, along with the capability to pick up and use items like keys or equipment.

            <h2>Racetrack AI</h2>
            <p>The goal of this project was to set up a simple machine learning program with JavaScript that could drive around the racetrack. I used the Toy Neural Network libarary to create this program. The idea is that a set number of cars is automatically generated, all controlled by the neural network. They are able to detect the walls of the hardcoded racetrack through raytracing, which they can use to get better every round. When all cars died, the new ones are generated based on the best of the last round.

            <h2>Bomb Dodger</h2>
            <p>This is my latest project, which I've done together with <a class="inline" href="#">Karsten Veltman</a>. We made a game where the objective is to dodge the explosions of the various bombs spawning in the field. The player character is controlled by tilting the phone, which is done through the accelerometer. The game is also playable against each other in multiplayer, which is done through a combination of the Netcode for GameObjects and Unity Relay libraries. Here is a link to <a class="inline" href="bomb dodger.apk">download</a> the game.</p>
